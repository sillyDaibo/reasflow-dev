## Installed Root

Resolve the installed reasflow-dev private skills root before running packaged scripts:

```bash
REASFLOW_PRIVATE_SKILLS_ROOT="${REASFLOW_PRIVATE_SKILLS_ROOT:-}"
if [ -z "$REASFLOW_PRIVATE_SKILLS_ROOT" ]; then
  if [ -d ./.codex/reasflow-skills ]; then
    REASFLOW_PRIVATE_SKILLS_ROOT="$(pwd)/.codex/reasflow-skills"
  elif [ -d "$HOME/.codex/reasflow-skills" ]; then
    REASFLOW_PRIVATE_SKILLS_ROOT="$HOME/.codex/reasflow-skills"
  else
    echo "reasflow private skills not found in ./.codex/reasflow-skills or $HOME/.codex/reasflow-skills" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

# Toy Verification

## Overview
Tiny examples expose hidden assumptions fast. Use them to verify the mechanism, not to claim final performance.

## Workflow
1. Build the smallest example that still exercises the core logic.
2. Work through expected behavior by hand.
3. Add one adversarial edge case.
4. Record what the toy example validates and what it cannot.

## Deliverables
- worked example with expected outputs
- edge-case note
- go or no-go recommendation for scaling up
