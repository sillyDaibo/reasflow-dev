## Installed Root

Resolve the installed reasflow-dev skills root before running packaged scripts:

```bash
REASFLOW_SKILLS_ROOT="${REASFLOW_SKILLS_ROOT:-}"
if [ -z "$REASFLOW_SKILLS_ROOT" ]; then
  if [ -d ./.agents/skills ]; then
    REASFLOW_SKILLS_ROOT="$(pwd)/.agents/skills"
  elif [ -d "$HOME/.agents/skills" ]; then
    REASFLOW_SKILLS_ROOT="$HOME/.agents/skills"
  else
    echo "reasflow shared skills not found in ./.agents/skills or $HOME/.agents/skills" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
fi

REASFLOW_PRIVATE_SKILLS_ROOT="${REASFLOW_PRIVATE_SKILLS_ROOT:-}"
if [ -z "$REASFLOW_PRIVATE_SKILLS_ROOT" ]; then
  if [ -d ./.codex/reasflow-skills ]; then
    REASFLOW_PRIVATE_SKILLS_ROOT="$(pwd)/.codex/reasflow-skills"
  elif [ -d "$HOME/.codex/reasflow-skills" ]; then
    REASFLOW_PRIVATE_SKILLS_ROOT="$HOME/.codex/reasflow-skills"
  else
    echo "reasflow private skills not found in ./.codex/reasflow-skills or $HOME/.codex/reasflow-skills" >&2
    exit 1

# Experiment Execution

## Overview
This skill replaces the most important parts of the upstream terminal and workspace helpers with concrete commands the Codex agent can run.
Use it whenever Algorithm or Experiment needs to prepare `Alg_Exp/`, create a workspace-local virtual environment, capture logs, or turn a long run into a reusable shell script.

## Workspace Bootstrap
Set `SKILL_ROOT="$REASFLOW_PRIVATE_SKILLS_ROOT/experiment/experiment-execution"`.
Then prepare the shared workspace with:

```bash
bash "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/bootstrap-alg-exp.sh" "$PWD" Alg_Exp
```

This creates:
- `Alg_Exp/code/`
- `Alg_Exp/data/`
- `Alg_Exp/document/`
- `Alg_Exp/picture/`
- `Alg_Exp/logs/`
- `Alg_Exp/cache/`
- `Alg_Exp/temp/`
- `Alg_Exp/latex/`
- `Alg_Exp/scripts/`
- `Alg_Exp/.venv/`

If Python environment creation fails, use `uv` explicitly:

```bash
uv venv Alg_Exp/.venv
Alg_Exp/.venv/bin/pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn optuna pypdf
```

## Logged Execution
For short or medium runs that should execute now, capture a timestamped log with:

```bash
bash "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/run-with-log.sh" Alg_Exp/logs \
  Alg_Exp/.venv/bin/python Alg_Exp/code/test_algorithm.py
```

Always record the exact command, output path, and whether the run passed.

## Long-Running Commands
When a command is too long or expensive to run inline, generate reusable platform scripts first:

```bash
python "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/prepare-long-run.py" \
  --workspace "$PWD" \
  --output-root Alg_Exp \
  --command "python Alg_Exp/code/experiment.py --epochs 500 --seeds 1 2 3" \
  --script-name main_experiment
```

The helper writes both:
- `Alg_Exp/scripts/main_experiment.sh`
- `Alg_Exp/scripts/main_experiment.bat`

It also prints JSON containing:
- estimated runtime
- POSIX command
- Windows command
- detected virtual environment path

## Dataset Staging
When Experiment needs to copy or download a dataset into the shared workspace, use:

```bash
python "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/stage-dataset.py" \
  --source https://example.com/dataset.zip \
  --output-dir Alg_Exp/data/raw \
  --extract
```

The same helper also accepts local paths:

```bash
python "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/stage-dataset.py" \
  --source ./downloads/my_dataset \
  --output-dir Alg_Exp/data/raw
```

## Execution Contract
1. Bootstrap `Alg_Exp/` before the first serious run if the workspace is not already prepared.
2. Use the workspace-local `.venv` instead of system Python whenever possible.
3. For every important run, keep a stable log file under `Alg_Exp/logs/`.
4. For long jobs, generate scripts before handoff so the user or a later agent can rerun exactly the same command.
5. Stage downloaded or copied datasets under `Alg_Exp/data/raw/` unless the workspace already uses a stricter convention.
6. Put result files under `Alg_Exp/data/`, `Alg_Exp/picture/`, or `Alg_Exp/document/` instead of ad hoc locations.

## Deliverables
- executed command ledger with log paths
- generated run scripts for long jobs when needed
- note on missing dependencies or environment issues
